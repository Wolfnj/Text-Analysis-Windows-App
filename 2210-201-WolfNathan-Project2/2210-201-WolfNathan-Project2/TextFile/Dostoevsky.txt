	And he kept his word; he died and left everything to his sons,
whom, with their wives and children, he had treated all his life
as servants. Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All
this became known afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his
advice to increase her capital and put business in her way.

	When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with
Grushenka over a piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise
by falling madly in love with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as
he was, was immensely amused. It is remarkable that throughout
their whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously
open with the old man, and he seems to have been the
only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when
Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left
off laughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern
and earnest piece of advice.

	If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you'd
better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel
will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand. But
don't keep on with the captain, you'll get no good out of that.
